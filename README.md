# Tic Tac Toe Game 🎮

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game I built in 2022 to practice coding in Java. It was a fun way to sharpen my skills in object-oriented programming, event handling, and basic UI concepts.

## 🚀 Features
- Classic Two-player mode
- Mouse input for selecting fields
- Logic to detect the winner
- Option to reset the game after a win/draw

## 🔍 What I Learned
- Handling user input with event listeners
- Managing game logic and player turns
- Writing cleaner, maintainable Java code
- Working with simple UI components

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PatrickUgwu/tic-tac-toe
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```
3. Compile and run the game:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

## 🧩 How to Play
**Objective**: The goal is to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent does.
1. The game starts with Player 1 (X).
2. Click on a square to place your mark.
3. Players take turns until one wins or the game ends in a tie.
4. When a player wins, the game board can be reset for a new round.

## 📚 Possible Improvements
- Add a single-player mode with AI
- Improve the UI with more visual enhancements
- Add a score tracker
